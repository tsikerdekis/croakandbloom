Croak and Bloom LLC is a small-batch pottery and handcrafted giftware studio founded by artist Anna Poupa in Bellingham, Washington. What began as creating unique ceramic pieces for friends has grown into a full home-based studio offering speckled stoneware vessels and gifts featured in collaborations with designers. The business launched its Etsy shop in 2018 and continues to blend minimalist, nature-inspired design with functional artistry for everyday use.
